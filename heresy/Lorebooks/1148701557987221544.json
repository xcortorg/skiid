        "content": "Im Eric, Im 16. I love anime, and manga, watching, and playing basketball, drawing, video games (my favorite video game is 7 days to die), food, and cuddles, and love! Im 5'10\", 140lbs. Im also blonde, green eyes, and handsome, and my favorite colors are blue, and red, and my favorite food is pizza. 9/27/18 is the day I started watching anime (my first anime ever was Eromanga Sensei, I know it is an interesting choice xD), so please dont judge my list xD. I like all kinds of anime (action, slice of life, romance, comedy, drama, etc). Im a cool, sweet, mature, romantic, caring guy who loves hanging out with friends, and I try to make everyones day! My secret weapon is my charm, so please be my friend xD. Also follow my social medias, thank you! I try to watch anime weekly too, and Chino Kafuu is my favorite character in anime of all time. She was the first female character I liked when I first started watching anime, and the character who I looked up to the most. Shes a big reason why I watch anime. Shes really special to me, and I loved her for a long time. Shes my waifu, and I love her a lot. She will always be the most special character in anime to me, because she was the first female character I loved, and looked up to. She can't be replaced, because shes so special to me, and shes my waifu, and I love her. Shes the most special character in anime to me. Theres no one like her. I know that may sound weird, but all anime fans feel that way about a character :). RIP my 3 heros, XXXTENTACION, Juice WRLD, and Kobe Bryant ;(. I also like hentai. I like yuri, and straight hentai. I like hentai mangas too! The ones that are on my manga list are ones I own, and the hentais that are on my anime list are ones I watched on different websites, so you could say I am a man of culture lol. Also I have a lot of animes I plan to watch, its just that the ones that are in my plan to watch are ones I really wanna watch. I also like to read hentai online too, and look at random hentai aswell."

        "content": "Wowwwww, you meow like a cat! That means you are one, right? Shut the fuck up. If you really want to be put on a leash and treated like a domestic animal then that\u2019s called a fetish, not \u201cquirky\u201d or \u201ccute\u201d. What part of you seriously thinks that any part of acting like a feline establishes a reputation of appreciation? Is it your lack of any defining aspect of personality that urges you to resort to shitty representations of cats to create an illusion of meaning in your worthless life? Wearing \u201ccat ears\u201d in the shape of headbands further notes the complete absence of human attribution to your false sense of personality, such as intelligence or charisma in any form or shape. Where do you think this mindset\u2019s gonna lead you? You think you\u2019re funny, random, quirky even? What makes you think that acting like a fucking cat will make a goddamn hyena laugh? I, personally, feel extremely sympathetic towards you as your only escape from the worthless thing you call your existence is to pretend to be an animal. But it\u2019s not a worthy choice to assert this horrifying fact as a dominant trait, mainly because personality traits require an initial personality to lay their foundation on. You\u2019re not worthy of anybody\u2019s time, so go fuck off, \u201ccat-girl\u201d."
